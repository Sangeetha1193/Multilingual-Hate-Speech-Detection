# Multilingual Hate Speech Detection System

A comprehensive, production-ready hate speech detection system that identifies and categorizes harmful content across five languages: English, Tamil, Hindi, Chinese (Mandarin), and Spanish. This system leverages state-of-the-art transformer models to achieve high accuracy in detecting hate speech across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.



## About the Project

This project addresses the critical need for automated hate speech detection in multilingual online environments. With the exponential growth of user-generated content across social media platforms, forums, and comment sections, manual moderation has become impractical. This system provides real-time, accurate detection of hate speech across multiple languages, enabling platforms to maintain safer online communities.

The system is designed to handle the complexities of multilingual content, including native script processing, cultural context understanding, and language-specific hate speech patterns. It achieves high accuracy through a combination of advanced deep learning models, comprehensive datasets, and optimized detection thresholds.

## Why Hate Speech Detection is Needed

Hate speech poses significant threats to online communities and society at large:

![Hate Speech Detection Example](sample.png)

*Example: Real-time hate speech detection on Reddit comments with word-level highlighting*

1. **Psychological Impact**: Hate speech can cause severe emotional distress, anxiety, and trauma to targeted individuals and communities.

2. **Social Division**: It perpetuates stereotypes, fuels discrimination, and creates divisions within communities.

3. **Platform Safety**: Online platforms struggle to moderate billions of posts daily, requiring automated solutions to maintain safe environments.

4. **Legal Compliance**: Many jurisdictions require platforms to actively monitor and remove hate speech content.

5. **User Experience**: Hate speech degrades the quality of online discourse and drives away users seeking constructive interactions.

6. **Multilingual Challenge**: The global nature of the internet requires detection systems that work across multiple languages and cultural contexts.

This project provides a scalable, accurate solution to these challenges, supporting five major languages and achieving production-grade performance.

## Project Overview

The Multilingual Hate Speech Detection System is a comprehensive solution consisting of:

- **Backend API Server**: Flask-based REST API serving a fine-tuned mBERT model for hate speech detection
- **Browser Extension**: Real-time detection and highlighting of hate speech in web browsers
- **Training Pipeline**: Complete infrastructure for model training, evaluation, and optimization
- **Data Processing**: Tools for dataset creation, augmentation, and preprocessing
- **Model Optimization**: Threshold tuning and performance optimization for each supported language

The system processes text input, detects the language automatically, applies language-specific detection models, and returns confidence scores along with classification results.

## How It Works

### Detection Pipeline

1. **Text Input**: User provides text through API endpoint or browser extension
2. **Language Detection**: System automatically identifies the language (English, Tamil, Hindi, Chinese, Spanish)
3. **Preprocessing**: Text is cleaned, normalized, and tokenized according to language-specific rules
4. **Model Inference**: Fine-tuned mBERT model processes the text and generates probability scores
5. **Threshold Application**: Language-specific optimized thresholds are applied to determine hate speech classification
6. **Keyword Override**: Strong hate keywords trigger additional validation for borderline cases
7. **Result Generation**: System returns classification (hate/neutral), confidence score, and language information

### Browser Extension Workflow

1. **Content Monitoring**: Extension monitors all input fields and comment sections on web pages
2. **Real-time Detection**: As users type, text is analyzed after a debounce period (500ms)
3. **Visual Highlighting**: Detected hate speech is highlighted in red with visual indicators
4. **Pre-submission Warning**: Before posting, users are warned if hate speech is detected
5. **Comment Scanning**: Existing comments on pages are scanned and highlighted automatically

### Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregates datasets from multiple sources (ETHOS, Davidson, HateXplain, OLID)
2. **Data Augmentation**: Generates synthetic samples using back-translation and paraphrasing
3. **Preprocessing**: Native script processing, text cleaning, and language-specific pattern matching
4. **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tunes mBERT on multilingual dataset with language-specific optimization
5. **Threshold Tuning**: Optimizes decision thresholds per language to maximize F1 scores
6. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive testing across all languages with detailed metrics

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Detects hate speech in English, Tamil, Hindi, Chinese (Mandarin), and Spanish
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 95.67% accuracy and 94.91% F1-macro score on test set
- **Language-Specific Optimization**: Custom thresholds and preprocessing for each language
- **Real-time Detection**: Browser extension provides instant feedback as users type
- **Visual Highlighting**: Red highlighting and badges for easy identification of hate speech
- **Pre-submission Blocking**: Warns users before posting hate speech content
- **Comment Section Scanning**: Automatically scans and highlights hate speech in existing comments
- **RESTful API**: Easy integration with existing applications

## Troubleshooting

### API Server Issues

- **Port already in use**: Change port in `src/api/app.py` or kill existing process
- **Model loading fails**: Check model path and file permissions
- **CORS errors**: Verify Flask-CORS is installed and configured

### Browser Extension Issues

- **Extension not working**: Check if API server is running on localhost:5000
- **No highlights appearing**: Verify extension is enabled in browser settings
- **API connection errors**: Check browser console (F12) for detailed errors

### Performance Issues

- **Slow inference**: Consider using GPU for faster processing
- **High memory usage**: Reduce batch size or use smaller model variant
- **Extension lag**: Increase debounce delay in content script
